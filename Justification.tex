Understanding the Universe at the most fundamental level and answering physics's most pressing questions requires a good understanding of the instruments used to make corresponding measurements and reliable methods to ensure their highest quality. As Carl Sagan said, ``Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.". The complexity of the phenomena and equipment used and studied in Experimental High Energy Particle Physics (HEP) needs a great rigor for the claims made. This proposal is based on research at the CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) Experiment that is located at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, Switzerland. The CMS Experiment is a complex apparatus designed to record an physics data on the order of several petabytes per second and a sophisticated trigger system and software to filter and process the information for physics analyses.

The thrust of this work is centered around CMS Trigger system filter out the relevant physics information and measure its efficacy for Emerging Jets (EMJs) analysis. Additionally, the work includes setting a framework for Machine Learning (ML) based Data Quality Monitoring (DQM) that automates and augments Data Certification (DC) process that otherwise is very tedious to perform manually.
