We discuss the main results and lessons learnt so far in the commissioning and early detector operation. We outline our practical operations arrangements and the key technical implementation aspects.}

Its flexibility allowed its integration in several environments: Online, for real-time detector monitoring; Offline, for the final, fine-grained Data Certification; Release-Validation, to constantly validate the functionality and the performance of the reconstruction software; in Monte Carlo productions. The central tool to deliver Data Quality information is a website for browsing data quality histograms (DQM GUI). In this contribution, the structure of the DQM framework is described and the usage of the DQM software in the different environments and the performance of the system after the first years of data taking are presented.}

To ensure that the recorded data has the best quality possible, the CMS Collaboration has dedicated Data Quality Monitoring (DQM) and Data Certification (DC) working groups. These working groups are made of human shifters and experts who carefully watch and investigate histograms generated from different parts of the detector. However, the current workflow is not granular enough and prone to human errors. On the other hand, several techniques in Machine Learning (ML) can be designed to learn from large collections of data and make predictions for the data quality at an unprecedented speed and granularity. Hence, the data certification process can be considered as a perfect problem for ML techniques to tackle. With the help of ML, we can increase the granularity and speed of the DQM workflow and assist the human shifters and experts in detecting anomalies during data-taking. In this presentation, we present preliminary results from incorporating ML to highly granular DQM information for data certification.}
