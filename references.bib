  abstract = {In the last two years the CMS experiment has commissioned a full end to end data quality monitoring system in tandem with progress in the detector commissioning. We present the data quality monitoring and certification systems in place, from online data taking to delivering certified data sets for physics analyses, release validation and offline re-reconstruction activities at Tier-1s. We discuss the main results and lessons learnt so far in the commissioning and early detector operation. We outline our practical operations arrangements and the key technical implementation aspects.}

  abstract = {The Data Quality Monitoring (DQM) Software proved to be a central tool in the CMS experiment. Its flexibility allowed its integration in several environments: Online, for real-time detector monitoring; Offline, for the final, fine-grained Data Certification; Release-Validation, to constantly validate the functionality and the performance of the reconstruction software; in Monte Carlo productions. The central tool to deliver Data Quality information is a website for browsing data quality histograms (DQM GUI). In this contribution, the structure of the DQM framework is described and the usage of the DQM software in the different environments and the performance of the system after the first years of data taking are presented.}

  abstract  = {The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector is getting ready for datataking in 2022, after a long shutdown period. LHC Run-3 is expected to deliver an ever-increasing amount of data. To ensure that the recorded data has the best quality possible, the CMS Collaboration has dedicated Data Quality Monitoring (DQM) and Data Certification (DC) working groups. These working groups are made of human shifters and experts who carefully watch and investigate histograms generated from different parts of the detector. However, the current workflow is not granular enough and prone to human errors. On the other hand, several techniques in Machine Learning (ML) can be designed to learn from large collections of data and make predictions for the data quality at an unprecedented speed and granularity. Hence, the data certification process can be considered as a perfect problem for ML techniques to tackle. With the help of ML, we can increase the granularity and speed of the DQM workflow and assist the human shifters and experts in detecting anomalies during data-taking. In this presentation, we present preliminary results from incorporating ML to highly granular DQM information for data certification.}
