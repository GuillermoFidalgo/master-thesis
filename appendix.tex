Besides the above, I have also contributed to HEP Snowmass process \cite{snowmass_site} in Community Engagement Frontier \cite{snowmass_engagement}. In particular, I co-authored papers in CommF4: Physics Education \cite{snowmass_edu}  and CommF2: Career Pipeline \& Development \cite{snowmass_carrerdev}. This led to three publications \cite{malik2022broadening,bardeen2022particle,malik2022facilitating}.

I have also been an integral part of mentoring in the USCMS internship program~\cite{pursue_site,fnal_int} at Fermilab and have been acknowledged here \cite{bose2022us,banerjee2024novel} where I have co-developed software curriculum for the interns and been an instructor for past three years.

% My work on broader impacts on outreach in HEP has led to the following publications

The software experience gained from this work enabled me to disseminate my experience to students from UPRM and the international HEP community. I have organized several Python and HEP data analysis trainings and workshops, in Puerto Rico at UPRM and HEP worldwide \cite{carp21,carp22,carp22b,DAFLR,matplot,MLatCROEM23,PythoSeriesBasics,PythoSeriesMatplot,PythoSeriesML,PythoSeriesPandas,UPRM_ML_Undergrad}.
This has been an extremely fruitful outcome of my learning experience and a great sense of giving back to the community.
